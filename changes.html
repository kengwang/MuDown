<h2>New Windows Installer</h2>
<p>18. December 2018</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Windows installer for Multicraft has been updated to be more user friendly and more flexible. All services related to Multicraft (webserver, database server and Multicraft daemon) are installed as Windows services so you can start/stop them directly in the Windows service manager.
The installer is designed to support multiple installations in different locations. When re-installing to the same location it will keep existing user/server data. We still highly recommend backing up your user and server data prior to doing any changes to your installation.</p>
<p>Please let us know how the installer worked for you and if you have any suggestions for further improving it or additional feature requests.</p>

<h2>Multicraft 2.1.1</h2>

<p> </p>
<p>Multicraft 2.1.1 has been released as a first maintenance release of the latest Multicraft version. This release contains mostly minor cosmetic changes and fixes as well as improvements to Docker support so upgrading is optional and only required if you are encountering any of the issues listed in the changelog.</p>

<h2>BukGet Shutdown</h2>
<p>07. December 2016</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are sorry to see the BukGet project being shut down and we would like to extend a warm thank you to the people who have maintained this project in the past.</p>
<p>If you are using Multicraft version 2.1 the plugin browser should continue working as expected.</p>
<p>In older versions of Multicraft the plugin browser will no longer work so we recommend updating to the latest version to address this. If that&#39;s not (yet) possible for you the issue can be worked around temporarily by replacing line 14 (the API URL) of the &quot;protected/models/BgPlugin.php&quot; file with the following:</p>
<pre><code>    static $apiUrl = &#39;http://plugins.multicraft.org/bg_compat/bukkit&#39;;
</code></pre>

<h2>Multicraft Apps</h2>
<p>14. Nov 2016</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The steady growth of Multicraft has motivated the creation of several apps for different platforms. While Multicraft comes with a mobile theme that works on most devices out of the box we wanted to highlight some community created apps that can help control your servers. Most apps support basic controls and server access and even multi-server management. All of these highlighted apps are completely free and they have been created independently, we are not affiliated with them in any way.</p>
<p>To use these apps a recent version of the control panel is required (2.0+), also the hosting provider needs to supply an API key for you to enter to use the app.</p>
<p>(in order of last update)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.silocitylabs.multicraft'>Remote for Multicraft (Android)</a></p>
<p>The Remote for Multicraft App is for Minecraft server admins that use Multicraft control panel. Connect to your Multicraft control panel to check your server status and players from your phone. Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>server stats: RAM, CPU, player count</li>
<li>power controls: start/stop/kick/ban/pardon</li>
<li>player list and info: level, online/offline, last seen time</li>
<li>status check of Minecraft&#39;s and Mojang&#39;s services</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobilecraft/id1043877770'>MobileCraft (iOS)</a></p>
<p>MobileCraft is the portable version for the famous hosting platform &quot;Multicraft&quot;. It fits anyone from server hosts to casual server owners. All you need to have to control your server, just one click away. You can view your console, kick players, start and stop your server anytime of the day with just a click in MobileCraft.</p>
<ul>
<li>Server management (start, stop, restart, delete, suspend, resume)</li>
<li>Console (view console, and send console commands)</li>
<li>Online players (kick and ban players directly from the app with a button)</li>
<li>User management (change password, delete users, list servers)</li>
<li>MYSQL database (create, change password)</li>
<li>And many more!</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oliverdunk.pocketpanel'>PocketPanel for Minecraft (Android)</a></p>
<p>Server Administration shouldn&#39;t be hard - now, it&#39;s easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control your server with actions like start, stop, restart and more.</li>
<li>Check your console and run commands.</li>
<li>For panel administrators, create servers, delete them and control servers globally.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Billing System Modules</h2>

<h2>Multicraft 2.0.0</h2>
<p>12. December 2015</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are proud to announce the release of version 2.0.0 of Multicraft! A lot of effort has gone into making sure that we can implement as many user suggestions as possible with this new version of Multicraft to make it even more powerful and easy to use. The release has been postponed a number of times because of feature requests that we consider to be very useful to the vast majority of Multicraft users. Due to this we have begun offering preview releases for download longer before the final release than usual. If you&#39;re running a preview release we strongly recommend upgrading to the final 2.0.0 version.</p>
<p>In addition to implementing countless new features and improvements we have also been able to make Multicraft even more secure thanks to the researchers who have contributed to our <a href='https://bugcrowd.com/multicraft'>Bug Bounty Program</a> we have running with Bugcrowd.</p>
<p>As part of this release we are replacing the Windows all-in-one package with the <a href='https://bitnami.com/stack/multicraft/installer#windows'>Multicraft Bitnami Stack for Windows</a> for personal use. There is also a <a href='https://bitnami.com/stack/multicraft/installer#linux'>Multicraft Bitnami Stack for Linux</a> that we recommend for personal use if you cannot install all requirements for Multicraft. For hosting providers we still recommend using our Linux packages for maximum security and flexibility.</p>
<p>In good Multicraft tradition the length of the changelog is record breaking. There have been so many new features and changes that even a summarized list of the most important changes would be too long for this news entry so here&#39;s just a small selection:</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li>New theme using Bootstrap</li>
<li>Improved server crash and console handling, including the option to use .conf files for arbitrary JAR names</li>
<li>New Staff role for full access to all servers without giving access to panel settings</li>
<li>Server template system</li>
<li>Improved Bukkit plugin list</li>
<li>Optional startup parameters</li>
<li>API improvements and additions</li>
<li>Security improvements</li>
<li>Linux filesystem quota support</li>
<li>Configuration reloading</li>
<li>Improved performance, particularly for very large installations (1000+ servers)</li>
<li>Removed single instance restriction so you can run multiple daemons with different Owned license keys on the same system</li>
<li>Reduced the number of times the banner is shown in the free version</li>
<li>Many, many more small and large features, improvements and fixes!</li>

</ul>

<h2>Multicraft Bug Bounty Program</h2>
<p>22. May 2015</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a last step before the finalization of the new release we have ordered a security review for Multicraft and we have launched a Bug Bounty program with the good folks over at <a href='https://bugcrowd.com/'>Bugcrowd</a>.
The program has initially been launched as private so if you&#39;re interested in participating and earning monetary rewards for reporting security critical bugs please head over to <a href='https://bugcrowd.com/user/sign_up'>bugcrowd.com</a> to register for a researcher account. Once you have done so please let us know so we can add you as a researcher to our program.</p>
<p>The bug bounty program will be made public in the future once we have left the initial selection of researchers enough time to review the code.</p>
<h2>Blesta Multicraft Module <em>- Updated</em></h2>
<p>29. September 2014</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are happy to announce that the good folks over at <a href='http://www.blesta.com/'>Blesta</a> have developed a module to fully support Multicraft with their billing software platform. A video of the module in action can be seen in their blog entry regarding this development:
<a href='http://www.blesta.com/2014/06/03/new-module-multicraft/'>Blesta Blog: New Multicraft Module</a></p>
<p>The module is part of the official v3.3 release of Blesta so you do not have to install any addons to use this module. If you are using an older version of Blesta you can download the module separately from <a href='http://www.blesta.com/forums/index.php?/topic/2743-module-multicraft/'>this forum post</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation for this new module can be found here:
<a href='http://docs.blesta.com/display/user/Multicraft'>Blesta Multicraft Module Documentation</a></p>
<p>You can try the new module without obligation by installing the free trial of Blesta and connecting it to your existing Multicraft installation.</p>
<p>We will also be sending out 15% discount coupons for Blesta owned licenses with every new purchase of any Multicraft license.</p>
